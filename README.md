# Kantle

This is a Kant vocabulary word game
## For developers

You're very welcome to create your own Wordle offshoot/remix based on _hello wordl_. To get started, you can [fork the code](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on GitHub.

To run the code locally, first install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm). Then, in this directory, open a terminal and run `npm install` followed by `npm run start`. _hello wordl_ will be running at http://localhost:3000/. Any changes you make to the source code will be reflected there. Have fun!

Finally, `npm run deploy` will deploy your code to the `gh-pages` branch of your fork, so that everyone can play your version at https://yourname.github.io/hello-wordl (or the name of your fork if you renamed it).
